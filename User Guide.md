# User Manual for **Illuminati**
# Introduction
Illuminati was an instant hit when it was released in 1982 and has been the recipient of multiple Origins awards. It has been Steve Jackson's signature title ever since. Two to six players compete to take control of groups ranging from the FBI and CIA, to the Dentists, increasing their wealth and power for further takeovers, until one rules supreme. Every player has different victory conditions! No ploy is too devious, no stratagem too low, as you scheme your way to victory! 
Group J has taken to implement this hit board game on the PC where you can play with your friends.
